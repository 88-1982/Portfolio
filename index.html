          <p> My name is DeAunte Hall. I was born in Seattle, Wa but have also lived in California and Detroit,
            Michigan.
            My hobbies include weight lifting and riding BMX 29" bikes.
            I was also really into breakdancing and sports throughout high school and in my early 20's. I was one of the
            founding members and a professional dancer for the world famous Massive Monkees.

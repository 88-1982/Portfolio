    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p> My name is DeAunte Hall. I was born in Seattle,  Wa but    have also lived in California and Detroit, Michigan.
  My hobbies include weight lifting and riding BMX 29" bikes.
  I was also really into breakdancing and sports throughout high school and in my early 20's. I was one of the founding members and a professional dancer for the world famous Massive Monkees.
